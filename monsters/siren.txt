The floor of this room has a lush carpet of grass. A tree appears to have grown in the middle of the room. The branches of the tree have grown woven into the shape of a cage. There are very few leaves, so you are able to clearly see the bird trapped in the cage. It hops on its little perch, tilts its head, and begins to sing. 
The song is captivating, entrancing. Hypnotized, you approach the bird and free it from the cage. Once free, the bird looks different. It retains the bird body, but it's face is that of a woman. It begins to sing again, and you start to feel your self-control slip away.
What do you do?
