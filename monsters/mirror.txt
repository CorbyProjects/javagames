This room is well-lit. In the middle of the room is a small table with a fancy table cloth. You approach the table and see a mirror slightly propped up so the glass is facing you. As you get closer, your reflection shows in the mirror. You notice the reflection begins to shimmer and vibrate. The room begins to darken. 
The shadows pull together and solidify until you are now looking at yourself. 
Your reflection has left the mirror, and is now in front of you with a menacing sword.
