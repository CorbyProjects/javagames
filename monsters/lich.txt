A horrible stench smacks you in face as you enter the room. You struggle to breathe the rancid air. A tall shadow looms on the other side of the room. With every move the shadow makes, you hear a faint clacking. It stretches an arm out to you, and you see exposed bones under the torn remains of a cloak. 
A bony hand points directly at you. 
As the skeleton chants quietly its hand begins to glow.
