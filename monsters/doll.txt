A tall shadow spreads across the wall. It slowly shrinks as the source approaches you from the far corner. The figure is actually quite short, only about a foot tall. It looks like a little girl, complete with curly hair and a cute little dress. However as you look you notice the shine in her skin, and her dead, glassy eyes. She giggles, but her pink porcelain lips never move.
What do you do?
