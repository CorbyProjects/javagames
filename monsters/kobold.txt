The room appears empty. However after you check one corner, you turn around to see a candle. You approach the candle, but it goes out and the corner is consumed in shadow once more. You hear a shuffling behind you, and another corner has a small child wearing rags hunched over. As the child stands, you see it's no child, but a kobold. It's still short with a hunched back, glaring down it's big nose at you.
What do you do?
