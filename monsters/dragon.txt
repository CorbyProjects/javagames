As you enter the room, the echo of your footsteps becomes muffled. Even though it's not very bright, the walls seem...closer than usual. Maybe it's just the warmth in this room getting to you. You see a hint of light in the center of the room, as though there were a distant fire farther away than the close space would allow. The fire swirls and grows, building into a ball. Or maybe an orb. 
As the fire grows, the room begins to illuminate. Those walls that were close aren't just walls. They glisten and absorb the light. A second ball of light forms, and in the middle of them you see a row of teeth as tall as a person. Eventually the light finishes filling a very large set of eyes and nostrils. The monster then uncoils and you finally see the full size of the dragon. Your eyes make contact, and a low rumble begins in the dragon's throat.
