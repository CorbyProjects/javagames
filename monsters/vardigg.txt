You nearly trip as you enter the room, as the floor is two feet lower than usual. The sunken floor is filled with water. The disturbance you create in the water ripples out, yet it doesn't disturb the water in the center of the room. Small ripples begin to emanate from the center of the room, but quickly grow to waves. 
The waves get taller and begin to take the shape of a head and limbs. An evil grin crosses the vardigg's face as it turns to face you directly.
What do you do?
