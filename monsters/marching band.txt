The room is huge. What terror could possibly need this much space? What horrors are impending upon you? You hear a distant thump-thump-thump. It grows louder. Thump. Thump. Thump. An army begins to take shape. Their robes are bright, with stripes down the sides of their legs and bright half-capes. They all wear tall hats that cover their eyes, and have a large yellow plume of feathers on top.
You think you're in for a jolly musical time, until the band starts playing. The booming sound reverberates through you, nearly knocking you over. The army begins to march. Metal spikes gleam as the rows of musicians high-step in your direction. Clearly they aren't stopping until they trample you.
What do you do?
