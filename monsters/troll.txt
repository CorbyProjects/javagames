A computer screen against the far wall is the only source of light. A large figure is hunched in front of the light. You see the outline of a fedora, and the room smells a bit. The hunched figure gives a low chuckle as he turns to face you. The chuckling sets his neck beard wiggling. 
"LOL You mad bro?" he asks.
