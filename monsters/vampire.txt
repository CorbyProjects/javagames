A sickly sweet scent hangs thickly in the air. Soft Baroque music plays, the harpsichord singing gentle choirs of notes. The room is filled with lush carpets, stuffed furniture, everything dripping with carved details. The light of candles spread thoughout the room dances off of the mirrors on all of the walls. A richly dressed man welcomes you with open arms, beckoning you to join him for a rest from the troubles of this maze. He is handsome and charming, and he doesn't have a reflection in any of the mirrors...
What do you do?
