8 feet of leathery green orc is reclining in chair, reading. He looks over his glasses at you, and sighs. He gently folds the book and glasses and sets them on the arm of the chair. He slowly stands, and you see he's actually 10 feet tall. He is covered in layers of sturdy leather armor.
He reaches behind the chair and pulls an axe as big as you are tall.
